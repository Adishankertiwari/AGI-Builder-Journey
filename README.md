# AGI-Builder-Journey
My path to mastering AGI from zero
AGI is the way to solve a lot of problems the humanity is facing right now, for eg energy efficiency, physics, mathematics, pollution, chemistry etc
I must build it to take my human civilization ahead, and to solve the current problems which can cause future generation their lives.
# AGI Builder Journey

## Mission:
To build Artificial General Intelligence that can reason, learn, and adapt like a human — but at superhuman scale. Not just another AI model — a true general intelligence that transforms civilization.

## Starting Point:
- Zero coding experience
- 100% commitment
- Daily execution
- Ruthless accountability

## Why:
Because waiting for someone else to build the future is cowardice. I'm here to build it myself — one commit at a time.

## Rules:
- No excuses
- Daily progress
- Public accountability

## First Goal:
Learn Python, Git, and core AI tools.
Build foundational neural networks from scratch by end of Month 1.
